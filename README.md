# STM32_Garbage_Manager
I developed a waste collection system with a DC motor-driven rotating brush. A rotary encoder controls up to 10 speed levels, shown on an LCD display. The menu includes two submenus for battery life and brush speed. The system is integrated into an autonomous robot for waste collection.
